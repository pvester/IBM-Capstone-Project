    "# A Quantitative Estimation of Reviews from Medical Test Subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Testing of new medicine from medical companies is a complex and long process, as you have to check for both short-term and long-term side effects. On top of that human test subjects are needed in the final testing phase of the medicine, making the process both very long and expensive if sufficient statistics has to be obtained. Furthermore the reviews from human test subjects are often not quantitative but qualitative with text descriptions rather than ratings. In this project I try to make an algorithm to translate the qualitative descriptions from the human test subjects to quantitative ratings in order to better and faster conclude on the quality of new medicine to be tested. For this purpose I use already labelled data from drugs.com extracted by by Surya Kallumadi (Kansas State University) and Felix Grässer (Technical University of Dresden). The dataset has 3,100 reviews and labels (Review score from 1-10). I will try to build a predictor of the ratings based on those text reviews. If successful the project can be presented for institutional organisations that 1) determines the quality of new medicine and 2) carries out the testing on human subjects.\n",

    "Files were already divided into a trainig and a test dataset, and they were renamed to training_data.tsv (75 % of the data) and test_data.tsv (25 %) for convenience."

      "1591    i first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. i was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. this is totally true. at first i wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. this really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. this way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. yes, i still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. i wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. this works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. people and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just works, rather than trying to give them ssri's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. and, the doctor's out there who decide that ssri's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!\n",

    "We notice that the rating is evaluated from 1 to 10 and the scale is subjected to personal bias and noise. There could be no reason for a person to give a 8 instead of 9 or 10 if the drug works well. Consequently, the 'rating' column is grouped into 3 simple bins: bad, medium, and good results. This helps us a lot in categorization and improves the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models can also be improved by tuning the parameters by utilizing grid search to find the optimal points. However, without tuning, the performance for decision tree is at around 0.80 based on the one-hot encoding of effectiveness and sideeffect scores which is quite good and a baseline for the review score predicter. Count vectorization and multimodal naive Bayes of the actually text gives us a review score predictor with a f1-score of 0.40 and 0.57 respectively. A model based on Deep Learning and TensorFlow/Keras gave an accuracy of 80 %. We are starting to get nearer to something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step might to look at performance for a 2-step score predictor, instead of the 3-step predictor investigated in this project. That also depends on the stakeholders"
