# A Quantitative Estimation of Reviews from Medical Test Subjects
A capstone project for the Coursera Course "IBM Advanced Data Science"

## Introduction
Testing of new medicine from medical companies is a complex and long process, as you have to check for both short-term and long-term side effects. On top of that human test subjects are needed in the final testing phase of the medicine, making the process both very long and expensive if sufficient statistics has to be obtained. Furthermore the reviews from human test subjects are often not quantitative but qualitative with text descriptions rather than ratings. In this project I try to make an algorithm to translate the qualitative descriptions from the human test subjects to quantitative ratings in order to better and faster conclude on the quality of new medicine to be tested. For this purpose I use already labelled data from drugs.com extracted by by Surya Kallumadi (Kansas State University) and Felix Gr√§sser (Technical University of Dresden). The dataset has 3,100 reviews and labels (Review score from 1-10). I will try to build a predictor of the ratings based on those text reviews. If successful the project can be presented for institutional organisations that 1) determines the quality of new medicine and 2) carries out the testing on human subjects.
